      <h2>About <span wicket:id="productname">HeadsUp</span></h2>

      <p><span wicket:id="productname2">HeadsUp</span> is a product to help you manage your software projects quickly and easily.</p>
      <p>The HeadsUp Development philosophy is that you should be able to see everything related to your
        software project in one place</p>
      <p>We believe that what you are trying to achieve is the most important thing to you and your team!
        Why should you have to worry about managing testing, documentation and so on when it can be done for you?</p>

      <p>If a part of your project needs your attention let us give you the HeadsUp :)</p>
