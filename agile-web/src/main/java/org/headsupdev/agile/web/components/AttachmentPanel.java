/**
 * This handles the UI interaction of uploading a file to HeadsUp.
 * The class that uses this will still need to persist the attachment by adding it to some model.
 * This should generally be implemented in the onSubmit() on the class.
 * There are getters for the filename and attachment if either are required.
 * Currently the filename is used as a helper for creating a comment.
