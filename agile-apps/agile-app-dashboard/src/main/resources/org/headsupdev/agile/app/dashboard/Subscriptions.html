      <p>This is currently configured to only send out build failure notifications, further configuration will be added shortly.</p>
      <p>Subscriptions enable you to be notified when anything changes in a project.
        It is like a personal email notifier, messages will be delivered directly to your account's email address.</p>
      <p>Choose your subscriptions from the list below, if a project is missing then ask your administrator to add
        you to the member list. Remember you can change your subscriptions at any time.</p>
